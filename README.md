# Cookie Menu Popup with "Accept all" Button

**Increase the acceptance of cookies and tracking scripts by opening the cookie configuration in a popup on first visit. Optionally adds the button "Accept all".**

With this plugin you can increase the acceptance of cookies and tracking scripts in your shop. The default theme only shows a subtle cookie hint, which can easily be overlooked. Furthermore, it requires many clicks until you have activated all functions - in practice, cookies and scripts often remain deactivated.



This plugin solves the problem. If no settings have been saved yet, the menu with the cookie configuration will be opened immediately. Instead of the offcanvas, the menu is displayed in a popup. The user has to make a decision and cannot simply click the dialog away.



An additional button "Accept all" can be added optionally, so that the visitor does not have to activate each cookie individually.



Please note that we as a plugin manufacturer only provide the technical functionality. We assume no liability for complete GDPR conformity. Whether the use in your shop is legally permissible you have to check yourself.
